# How to understand data

## Key Points

- Run the `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.head()` methods on your data.
- Understand what each row represents.
- Understand what each column represents.
- Narrow down your data to the columns you want to use.
- Check the `mean`, `max`/`min`, and `std` of your data to see if there are any outliers.
- Maybe run `count_values` on some columns to see if you're looking for some specific rare values.
